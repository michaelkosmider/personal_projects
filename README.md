# personal_projects

This repository contains 4 of my major projects: 

1. An academic review of the paper Approximating Graph TSP by Matchings by MÃ¶nke and Svensson. The paper is concerned with cutting edge techniques used in the graphic variant of a well known problem called the Traveling Salesman Problem. The purpose of my review is to provide an introduction and present key ideas from the paper. 

2. A neural network written in python. It is written entirely from scratch using python and NumPy, other than a tiny bit of sklearn and matplotlib for data pre-processing and visualization, respectively. The model provides control over many neural network hyperparameters such as: learning rate, regularization, batch size used in gradient descent, number of epochs, as well as the shape and activation function. I implemented the gradient calculation using my own take on the math, and will be adding a detailed explanation soon. A toy example of how to work with the neural network is shown in modeltests.ipynb.

3. A shell and program scheduler written in C. Description coming soon.
4. A database system that can be used by healthcare practitioners, coming soon.
